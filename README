MensApp is a mobile application which shows weekly served meals of the mensas of the University of Trier, the FH Trier and some of the other institutions which are listed in SWT's (Studentenwerk Trier) menus. Moreover with the MensAppetizer you can bookmark your favorite meals. MensApp will sent a notification to you when your favorite meals are served in the mensa (currently this doesn't work in the web version). This app is currently only running on android and the web.
